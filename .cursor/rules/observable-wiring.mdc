# Observable wiring workflow

When the user asks to wire new Observable outputs into the Astro site, or to run the Observable wiring workflow:

1. **Read and follow** the full runbook in **agent-observable-wiring.md** at the project root.
2. Execute its steps in order (build in ns_obv, export, verify, wire mounts, update e2e if needed, validate).
3. Do not hand-edit `public/observable/`; it is generated from ns_obv.

If this rule is active, treat agent-observable-wiring.md as the single source of truth for this workflow.
